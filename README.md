# Addis Software Test Project

In this project, I used AI for the music-visualization component (the blinking background is generated using AI ‚Äì ChatGPT).  
Throughout the project, I also used AI for some debugging and fix suggestions ‚Äî the rest is mine.

## üîÑ System Flow

- Configured **Jest** for basic testing ‚Äî some components tested, but full unit/integration tests are pending due to time.

  - Used `useSelector`, `useEffect` to fetch and render data
- **Song creation**:
  - First tested with Postman
  - Then implemented the form on the frontend
- **Performance**:
